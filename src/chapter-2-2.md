Reflective reading involves reflecting on our own experiences and perspectives as we read and considering how they relate to the text. This type of active reading can help us develop greater empathy and understanding of others, as well as gain new insights into our own lives and experiences.

Close Reading

Close reading involves reading a text carefully and thoroughly, paying close attention to details and nuances. This type of active reading can help us uncover hidden meanings and themes in a text, as well as appreciate the craft and artistry of the writing.

Comparative Reading

Each type of active reading has its own benefits and purposes, and can be applied to a variety of texts and contexts. By understanding these different types of active reading, we can develop the skills and techniques needed to engage more effectively with the texts we read.
