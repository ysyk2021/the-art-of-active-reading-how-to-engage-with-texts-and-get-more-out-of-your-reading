What is Active Reading?
================================================================

Active reading is a process of engaging with a text in a way that promotes deeper understanding and retention of information. It goes beyond simply decoding words on a page; it requires us to actively think, question, and reflect on what we're reading.

In active reading, we use a variety of techniques and strategies to engage with the text, such as highlighting key passages, taking notes, summarizing information, and asking questions. By actively engaging with the text, we can better understand and remember important information.

Active reading is not just about reading more quickly or efficiently; it's about reading more effectively. By using active reading techniques, we can improve our comprehension and critical thinking skills, expand our vocabulary and language skills, and develop a greater appreciation for the texts we read.

Active reading can be applied to a wide range of texts, from academic articles and textbooks to novels and non-fiction books. It can also be used in different contexts, such as personal reading, academic reading, or professional reading.

Overall, active reading is a valuable skill that can help us get more out of our reading experiences, whether we're seeking to learn new information, improve our language skills, or simply enjoy a good book. By understanding what active reading is and how it works, we can start developing the habits and techniques needed to become more effective and engaged readers.
