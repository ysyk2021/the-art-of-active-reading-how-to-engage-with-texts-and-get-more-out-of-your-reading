Asking questions is an important aspect of engaging with the text. By questioning the material, we can better understand the author's perspective and identify areas where we may need further clarification or research. Here are some tips for asking effective questions:

* Ask both open-ended and closed-ended questions
* Use the 5 Ws (Who, What, Where, When, Why) and How
* Focus on key ideas or concepts in the text
* Consider your own biases and assumptions when formulating questions

Making Connections

Making connections between the text and our own experiences and knowledge can also help us engage with the text more deeply. Here are some tips for making effective connections:

* Look for similarities and differences between the text and your own experiences or knowledge
* Consider how the text relates to current events or other texts you have read
* Identify common themes or patterns across different texts or topics
* Reflect on how the text has impacted your own thinking or worldview

By asking questions and making connections while reading, we can enhance our understanding of the material and make it more relevant to our own lives. This can lead to a deeper appreciation of the text and its significance, as well as greater personal growth and development.
